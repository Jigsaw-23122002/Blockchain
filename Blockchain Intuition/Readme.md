# Blockchain

Blockchain is a disruptive technology.
Disruptive technology is a technology that completely changes the traditional technology into a more enhanced version.
For eg: Tanga was replaced by car, bus and other vehicles as they are fast and more feasible as compared to the tanga. So they are disruptive technology. Similarly Email, Internet is also the disruptive technology in the communication environment.

(Blockchain is used for trust environment on internet).

## What is trust 

Let's consider an example of buying a coffee from the reputed coffee store which promises to provide some good ingredients into its coffee. But how can we actually know that the coffee which the reputed store providing actually contains those nutrients.
So Using blockchain, we can have some trust under such conditions.

## Blockchain technology :

In layman language, blockchain is a decentralized, immutable and transparent ledger.
(Ledger is like a entry book or data book which keeps the track of all transaction).

Lets consider the example of a shopkeeper selling a flour to a man in debt of rupees 1000 and enters this debt record into its ledger book in front of man. But after the man goes from the shop, the shopkeeper changes this 1000 rs to 2000 rs. So this is wrong.
    
In case of blockchain, this record is stored in the BLOCK and this CHAIN of BLOCKS(records) form the ledger book. In blockchain, the data once feed to the block can NEVER be changed.
Now whenever some change is done to the blockchain in one device, the changes if valid are reflected in all the other copy of blockchain available with all the devices on the network. So this means that blockchain is decentralized.

This gives rise to the question in our mind that - the copy of ledger is available with everyone on the network. So everone will be able to see our transactions. But this is not the case, the block contains all its data encrypted and its data can only be accessed by the one who are the owner of the block in the blockchain. So the data is very safe.

## Applications of blockchain :

1) Product tracking (can be used to check whether the product is original or fake)
2) Smart contract (It is special type of program that runs on etherium blockchain)

3) International wire transfer (transfering money from one country format to another country format. In case of centralized system this is disadvantageous due to the high cost charged by the intermediate banks and the time taken for the conversion is also high.Using blockchain cuts down the cost and time by larger extent).
4) Health Care System
Consider an example where a person visits a hospital 'A' for all health realted problem he has. So all the details about the diagnonis of the person is stored in the database of hospital 'A' and suppose in future the same person goes to hospital 'B' then they will not have any details about the previous diagnosis of the person. So this was the problem of centralized database of the hospitals.
Blockchain helps to decentralize this data and helps the hospital 'B' to also access the previous diagnosis details of the person.
